Hello everyone and welcome to HUZTLE, a podcast series centered around the journey and insight from gen z entrepreneurs and creatives. I talk to young people who are tech enthusiasts, founders and innovators who are at the intersection of stem and leadership. They share their experience and lessons they've learned and their own visions for the future of their respective fields. I am your host, Rachel Lombok. 

Our guest today is Anna Sang, a young creative public speaker, student photographer and Forbes 30 under 30 2021 nominee. Anna has worked with brands such as unique, low fujifilm Walgreens and creates editorial content for her non profit magazine, pulse spikes, which has garnered over 200,000 readers all over the world. She's incredibly passionate about making use centered and driven content and creating positive impact with her work. Anna welcome to the show. 

Thank you for having me. Yeah. 

First question I would like to ask is if you can please introduce yourself and talk about what you currently do as well as give us some insight into what really drew you into the field that you're currently in. 

Of course, so I do. I always have a little bit trouble figuring out like what titles my um, kind of my work, but generally I'm really interested in anything at the intersection of art and technology. Um, and seeing how those two fields that many people think are very different can be combined. Uh, so I do a lot of photography work. Um, I focused mostly on lifestyle editorial, portraiture stuff. And I also started a nonprofit publication called pulse spikes, which is a digital platform that showcases different young leaders across industries. So people who are working on creating animations to talk about climate change or authors, um, celebrating people of color. And so I'm really excited about stories and seeing how technology can be used to amplify those stories. Um, and I'm also doing some development sides and coding stuff also on the side and kind of growing that as well. 

What sort of sparked the interest for you? Uh you talked about arts first. Did you get into sort of your artistic creative side earlier in life, or was it your technical computing skills earlier? And how did what sparked the interest in those fields for you? 

So it did start mostly with the creative artistic side, I guess. I've always liked trying and painting and all of that stuff. And I'd say photography kind of started when instagram was born. I was kind of part of that. And so are you? I'm sure the generation that grew up alongside like the birth of instagram. And so when that platform started growing, especially when I was in middle school, that's when I took to seeing a lot of other young photographers and artists for their work on the platform. So that's how I started um doing some photography. It was usually mostly like with an iphone and just taking photos of like flowers and what not in my backyard and sharing those photos on instagram. Uh and that kind of grew a following from there and got to connect with a bunch of other young creatives on the platform and see what they were working on and what excited them. And that a little bit led to I guess the start of my magazine poll spice, which I started uh this summer before my freshman year of high school. And I found that there wasn't really a platform for young creatives to share their work. Um And I was I guess interested in seeing now that I had been connected with some people, other artists on the platform on instagram, how we could create a space that shared the work of young people. Um, and it started mostly on the art side and entertainment, but right now we kind of cover span a lot of different fields and industries and so that slowly lead to, I guess the, my interest in computer science though, I do have to preface that both of my parents are in the stem fields, but they never like pushed me to do anything stem related. Um, but the reason why I started doing some coding was because I wanted to create a website for my magazine and everything is kind of like on the internet now. So I wanted to create a digital space for the magazine. And so I had this, I found this theme like a template online and I wanted to figure out how I can customize it and kind of personalize it to fit what I was envisioning for pulse spikes. And so that's how I started learning how to code, just like Youtube tutorials and stuff like that. And it started with like small changes like some html CSS. Um and then I started doing a little bit more through various summer programs like Covid. Classy um girls who code and yeah, it's kind of wound I guess cultivating that area since. 

Yeah, that's really amazing. And of course also you are a student at Yale, currently studying computing and Arts. So I mean that directly ties into the two things that you were just discussing. Do you feel that your background in arts helps your technical computing skills and maybe like vice versa? Are there traits and skills that overlap in both fields that sort of play to your strengths? 

I think there are more similar than people think a lot of it, both art and technology is kind of figuring out pinpointing some sort of a problem and using whatever medium it is to solve that problem. So, um for arts, there's always something I feel like there's something that you can add personally into a conversation when you're creating a piece of art. And so um that's kind of my approach going into, into creating a piece of work. Um but I think also along those same lines with coding, um there's usually some sort of a problem that you want to solve, some sort, whether it's for a piece that or if it's some some different problem that you're interested in. Um and just using coding to be able to kind of reach, reach different audiences, which photography and are also um can do, it's just through different mediums, I guess, or different ways of approaching or solving. Um, that problem. So I think they for sure overlap in different ways. And of course right now we see a lot of overlap with like, human computer interaction, UI UX, that sort of stuff as well as computer graphics. Um, but kind of the approaches to I think are similar, right? 

And what you were mentioning before about like how you got started with your magazine, like creating your own website when you were like before high school, before high school, I didn't even know what like, like programming was and like I went to public school. So I don't even know if this is a thing, but they didn't have like sort of computer science programs or anything like that. So how did you begin to put yourself out there and seek out new opportunities when you were so young? 

Yeah, So I definitely also did not really, I did first did not code the entire website, it was more like, let me make some minor changes to this template, but that kind of sparked my interest in it, in creating something. And I think putting myself out there kind of came from, I usually had some sort of thing in mind that I wanted to accomplish, So like if it was my magazine's website, that was kind of the goal that I wanted to get to, and so the steps along the way to get there, I think because I had sort of that goal in mind or um some sort of a direction to go to, I think it was easier to tap into trying out new things along the way. So it's something that I think about is like um when people ask like, oh, how do I start coding, or or some sort of question that's like very broad and they're like millions of ways to go about it, whether it's like through tutorials online or um, through different summer programs, like with glossy or girls who code. Um, but if you have some sort of an idea in mind or some sort of problem again, um, I think it's easier to target what resources or even like what search queries to type in into google so that you have some sort of a direction, uh, to go from instead of like just putting yourself out there into the void and not really knowing what to do next. 

Yeah, definitely. In college I've learned, especially in stem or just computer science, like when I want to learn a scale, it's not just about looking at the documentation for programming language. Like it's about like really like diving in and like starting a project with it because that way you have an end goal in mind of like I need to accomplish this and this is how I'm gonna do with X, y and Z instead of just aimlessly, just looking up things. Um what would you say motivates you? Like obviously like you create that goal in your head of like creating a project, but how do you take that first step to sort of motivate yourself and like be sort of a self starter, especially because you are so young and people wouldn't expect that. 

I think it's, it's definitely difficult. There are many days where I'm just like putting things off too and I don't want to do anything. Um, and I think everyone has those sorts of days, but generally if I'm very excited about something I generally will have, um, even though it will take some time maybe to jump over those hurdles, I think I will get there eventually. And I think it was easier starting off when I was younger because I think I was more naive and I was like anything is possible, but I feel like as we kind of grew older, we start to care more about what other people think and also start to evaluate or like question our own abilities in many ways. And so I think I was really lucky and starting earlier on when I didn't really have a lot of those, um, those I guess like preconceived notions of like what I could or could not do sort of things um, in my mind when I was starting out earlier and so I think helping start like make the first leap when I was younger, helped in a lot of places in showing that I can at least accomplished something that I put my mind to. And I think showing myself that a younger age when I didn't have as much of the fear to take that first step was really helpful. But nowadays right now, I think I definitely think a lot more about whether or not I want to start a new project because I think there's there's always so much that we can do and there's only so much time in a day two and I'm trying to figure out um what really will excite me longer term to you and not necessarily. I feel like A lot of the times, um that now that we're in like a digital, like 24\/7 sort of a world that there's there's so much that we can do, but there's also not that much time to and trying to find a kind of figure out what I can do with that time and filtering out a lot of the noise that I feel like sometimes it can be easily, I can easily be overwhelmed by has kind of been a big focus at least this year too. 

Work smarter. Not harder, Exactly. Can you name three habits that helped make you successful? Like what I just said like working smarter instead of harder, is there anything that you attribute getting you further in life, any habits that you have or sort of just traits? 

I think for sure that it's important to take care of yourself and to get like quality sleep, especially in college. I feel like there's a culture around like working really hard and um and that sometimes takes a back seat and I feel like we're sure making sure um getting enough sleep and eating is important. But I also I guess I would say that another thing that potentially helps, um media started is that because I have interests and projects in different areas, I think it helps me when I feel stuck in one where I can kind of go into another and work on that a little bit more and see maybe if during that process of working on something else might help me untangle or debug something else just like in the back of my mind, we're just getting my mind off of something. Um, I found sometimes helps. Maybe also, I I tend to, I think I learned this at a younger age, but I tend not to like to procrastinate. Like I know that uh I found that some of my friends and peers do and like if it works for them, it works for them. But I know personally that it doesn't work for me. Like I'll end up getting very stressed close to like a deadline. And also, I think when I was younger I started doing concert photography when I was in like, I guess like ninth grade, eighth grade and my, um, it was kind of like schoolwork and all of that stuff still had to happen on like a day to day. Um, and these opportunities to be able to take photos of really cool artists and go to these concerts sometimes came up last minute. And so if I didn't have my work done ahead of time, I wouldn't be able to go to these cool experiences I think. And so I guess that sort of also trained me to less like put things off, but more so if I have the time earlier on to try to at least get a head start on it. And also, I think that's helped me like marigny over problems like for a longer period of time versus like a really short time crunch And trying to figure something out. So I guess that would be my 3rd 1. 

Wow, that's amazing. Especially the part that what you said about procrastination, in the fact that you were able to do that so young when like some people can't even do that transition for before college. That's really amazing. I want to talk for a second about what you just mentioned before, choosing projects that you're interested in and being passionate about what you're doing. Um when I met you, you were talking to me about an internship last summer with the Civic Digital Fellowship on helping create more accessible code. Can you tell me how that ties into your message of like helping youth and why you're passionate about it? 

Yeah, so I I feel really lucky to be able to have done the Civic Digital Fellowship last summer, um and it was a very cool experience even remotely. And so I I got to work on the kodiak of team, um working on improving the accessibility of the platform, and so I worked on a lot of front end development work um with that team, and I guess like, I guess the way that it would tie in, I don't know necessarily that like every single project has to fit into some sort of like end goal or I don't even have that sort of thing. But it was really exciting to me to be able to think about kind of ethical design and also think about how code can be made more accessible. And I think technology, it also helps in some ways reframe um the idea of technology and like innovation for me, because I think a lot of the metrics for innovation like nowadays are like the number of users that a platform can reach or like how much money you can make off of this platform. And I found that a lot of the metrics in kind of like working in the public sector is slightly different. I feel like the private sector has a lot to learn from it. And so like I remember hearing about um hearing about they have like listening sessions where we can hear um kind of how the public is interacting with government resources and information and what trouble they're facing when accessing these information resources. And sometimes that also boiled down to um how these websites were designed and developed. And so I think reframing the idea of innovation as it doesn't have to be like the flashy like new thing, but more so that it impacts like real people and sometimes small changes are also really meaningful. Um Was really helpful in like I guess my tech side or journey or whatnot. Um but also thinking about that in terms of my magazine and trying to make these stories as accessible as possible on the digital platform and really I guess boiling it down to because um as like a developer a lot of the time, you don't like meet the people who use your product. And I feel a lot of like the same way when I'm working on my magazine, like I don't meet a lot of my readers either but kind of like humanizing what we're working on it is really important. 

Yeah, that's really great. Digital and physical accessibility is very, very important. So you just mentioned like from that project, you sort of were more conscious of how you do things with your magazine. Um Do you take a lot of things that you do like maybe in your personal life or just like professionally and bring them back to your own personal projects? How do you sort of take things from what you learn and apply them to your own life or your own sort of endeavors? 

Yeah, for sure. So for like after I had no idea that like uh web accessibility, it was even a thing because it wasn't mentioned ever in the computer science classrooms or development class on design classrooms I was in and so I actually had like no idea going in like what that was and what that entails. And um and I think once I I feel like having that knowledge and like that recognition of like this is something that designers and developers should keep in mind and why are why is this not included in our curriculum was kind of a shock for me because like sometimes these changes are so simple and they're just not considered at all and I think um once I realized some like how I could um kind of approach it from like both the design and development um point of view, um I started thinking about also my personal projects, so uh things like my magazine, it did have a website change, I don't know if you noticed it at all. Um We did a lot of work on the magazine as a as a team like this past summer and so we worked on revamping this site um and we're trying to make it more accessible as well um in terms of like the color choices that we make and um and what not and keyboard accessibility and doing sorts of tests with that. Um So it definitely has I guess I I don't think I would necessarily separate it as like completely like personal projects versus like everything else or like an internship. And for me, I feel like I'm working on these personal projects like alongside these internships and whatnot. So it's not like okay, the internship is complete. Now I go like apply to a personal project, but more so um as I'm learning like throughout an internship, I can also start making some of those changes in terms of my personal projects are thinking about how it can apply, right? That's great. Constantly learning and constantly, you know, taking notes. 

That's always good. So now you are in school, can you outline or describe your typical week? 

Yeah, sure. I think it changes by the semester, but currently um currently I'm taking four classes. I'm taking two CS classes into our classes. And so this is the first semester where it's been like a divide like um completely in terms of CS and art. So previously I was doing like my different distributional requirements and taking um classes that were completely separate from my field of study. But this semester I'm taking four classes and I guess my week is probably class Mondays through Fridays on monday Wednesday friday the semester um until 5 30. And then I usually go and do some of my personal work after um after class and take some like one or two hours to do that on class days. Um But then I'm usually in office hours as I'm sure you're also um you also know about but I've been office hours a good amount of the time. Um And then on Tuesdays when I have my off days I'll usually take some time to work on like different problems sets like after, you know? Also even though classes aren't in session or we're not currently in class, there's still a lot of class work to do. Uh So I I usually do a lot of p sets on my off days, but I also do some photography um for the your social media accounts. And so uh sometimes I'll take walks around campus like right now. Um There's not like events and stuff like that which I would normally photograph like throughout the semester, but I'm going around campus taking some photos around different residential colleges and spaces. Um which has been fun as more of like a relaxing way. And then I'll usually go back to my piece that's uh work on my magazine a little bit in the night to and do some editing and stuff like that coordination. Um, and then on Saturdays on the weekends, Saturdays I usually have like my magazine meeting in the morning, um, with the team for kind of debriefing like what happened throughout the week. Um, questions concerns things that others need help on or that I need help on. We talked about then and then I club a club meeting, um, just now. So in the afternoon of saturday. Um, and then Sundays were also like an off day where I just like catch up on the work or anything that needs to be done before the next school week starts 

Very busy week. How do you stay organized? 

Um, so I used to not be a huge google calendar person, but I've recently adapted and become one. Yeah. So yeah, so this, yeah, organizing all my classes office, I was making curious all that stuff and it's really helpful to also have, um, market and when I'm supposed to do my covid tests are also totally forget, but I also put those in. Uh, and yeah, so I have, um, I have a little calendar with like events and stuff like that or like things that like I need to be at a certain time. And then, um, I recently also started using notion, I don't know if you know. Yeah. So I started using that for like tasks and stuff like that and kind of like keeping attractive, like links or things that I want to read later on, but I don't have the time to right now. So I have like some like embedded links for like my flanks and whatnot. Um, so I can return back to them when I have the time. Um, and I also started a reading list on there, which is kind of fun. Uh But yeah, that's kind of what I do to stay organized I guess most of it is kind of just sticking to my google calendar for things that I need to do by a certain time and then like um I just have tasks that I should do at one point, it's like if I don't have anything to do or a block time, I'll just go to that google calendar is like essential. 

If there's not a google calendar invite for it, I'm probably not going to come because I'll just forget about it completely. Exactly. Uh Yeah and you need, you need those reading lists or like bookmark things that you were mentioning. Especially in like virtual learning where there's like you have, well, I mean I don't know, but you have like web design, you have campus wire, you have piazza, you have zoom, you have like google classroom, like I need those bookmarks so that makes a lot of sense. What would you say is your biggest fear and how do you manage fear? 

Obviously I feel like like no one wants to fail. So obviously there's always like that that I love fear of failure but also um I guess I do I think I feel like I might think too much about what other people think of me at some point and I feel like um that shouldn't matter as much, but sometimes that's like in the back of my mind um when I'm thinking about something, so I guess that those are probably a few is like if you're, especially when I'm trying something new, it can be really intimidating to like go in. Especially um I think it gets even worse like the older you get to, especially when there are so many young people who have done it already, we're like who already have those skills that you're trying to learn um now and so I think those that that like feeling of like not belonging in a certain space or or um not fitting in for a certain reason is probably um something that I think about sometimes too, but how do I deal with it? I think I just have to come to terms with the fact that whether or not I do it, it's really based on my decision and like based on whether or not like all of my decisions and whether or not I want to do something um In the end it has to come from me and it can't come from like other people pressuring me to do something or um or me feeling like I need to do it to meet some other person's idea of what I have to do, but more so that if this is something that I'm really excited about and that I want to learn, I think eventually, even if it will take some time, especially the first initial steps eventually I feel more comfortable in that space and I think sometimes it's just about staying in those spaces a little bit longer than you feel like you're comfortable in or you feel okay, obviously don't stay in this basically like you don't feel upstate but like sometimes um to try something new that you might not feel comfortable doing, it could be beneficial long term, but obviously make careful and safe judgments when doing that. 

Right. Of course. Okay, my next question is, do you have any role models in your life? 

Yeah, I think people that are really cool that I I would say our role models are probably um Pamela Chen, I don't know if you know who that is, but um there was a lot of work at the intersection of like photography and technology. Um so I think a lot of her work is very cool. Um She's done some work at like instagram and National Geographic and I think it's really interesting how her, how her work has evolved like throughout the um the creation of a lot of these social media platforms and new ways of consumption and creation for photography and for different forms of art. Um So I thought that was really interesting and I think one of the first people that that I found who's worked intersected so closely with like photography, technology and society. Um so definitely a role model and I guess other role models um that or outside of my parents, but outside of my parents I think it could be a for sure. I think I think Amanda Gorman is obviously very very cool and amazing and incredible. I was actually really lucky to have photographed her um a couple of years back. I got to photograph her while I was in L. A. And she's absolutely incredible. Um I think what I guess like struck me the most is um probably just like how willing she was to experiment and to to put herself out there and um to really I think not back down from like a challenge or not um to put herself down to make others feel better. And I think um that she has a lot of power in vote her voice and also all of the incredible, amazing things she's done but just how how down to earth he also is and um I think how she kind of frames like our current social political climate in combination with art and um and poetry as an as an art form too. That was really inspiring 

Do have you had a big, wow moment in your life where you felt recognized for the work you were doing, like any award or honor maybe

 um one of the for sure, a really memorable moment was bringing like the mobile game idea that I had probably love to life and I had just submitted it into google play's change the game design challenge, not really giving it a second thought because I was like, they were going to have so many submissions, like they would never actually she's my and I think that was really exciting for me because of so many things, but also because I think that the I think there's there's when you have an idea in your mind and it's really hard to kind of articulated to everyone else and I think sometimes it's hard to like validate your own idea at times because it's like kind of in its abstract form and Um no one really knows about it, you're not even really 100 sure like what it's gonna be or evolved into as an end product. Um but then to be able to work with other really talented, like the designers and illustrators and engineers to actually bring it to life, um It's like the coolest experience, like to see it evolved from Point A to um Point being is so so excited. 
 
 Well I didn't know. So you made it and then submitted it and then they did like a re design or like you re implemented it again after you submitted it, How did it work? 
 
 So. No so the initial phases, just like the design, like some character sketches and like level design, like what I envision like the game looking like. Um And then some of like the game mechanics like how I think it could be implemented. Um And just like some notes about that, it wasn't like I didn't like actually coded up or like do any of that sort of stuff, it was more like an art or like an initial uh sketch, sketch sort of the face. And then after it was selected um I got to work with some other illustrators and um yeah designers to actually like finalize it and make it like look like I had mentioned it to be, wow. 
 
 That's cool. Yeah it's always cool to like get a project done or like off the ground like that. Okay. Where do you see yourself in five years? 
 
 Um I don't really know, but I think in five years hopefully, um I'll still definitely be interested in the arts and technology. Um I do think that I'm excited about new mediums for art and different ways to combine technology and art. I think in five years this is like a tentative like, where I wanna be. Um But I think it would be really cool to work on maybe my own thing, but I'm not sure, I'm not sure what it would be about or what it would be yet, but it could be really cool to work on. Um Something new. I also do think like some areas that I'm interested in exploring a little bit further in like the next five years, things like public art, which I find really interesting. Um Kind of thinking about different ways to reach new audiences and to make art more accessible, I guess in general, Instead of being confined to certain spaces, like galleries and museums and other institutions, um or things like ethical design, exploring a little bit more of that. Um and getting some more hands on experience with design. Um There's definitely something I'm interested in. Two. Um and the same with technology, of course, um exploring new new ways of creating a new languages and maybe doing some mobile, more mobile stuff can be fun too. 
 
 Yeah, so maybe your thing, like, you don't know what it is yet, but it sounds like you want to do a little bit of everything. 
 
 Yeah, I can't really choose right now, but those are just some areas generally right that I was interested. 
 
 Okay. And what are you doing in your free time? If you have any? 
 
 I look at you added that if you have, I'm sure you also can relate to feeling like you have no free time. Uh Where does time go? 
 
 I don't know. I brought a guitar in the beginning of the quarantine. And I literally, it's over there. I haven't touched it. 
 
 Like once you have to, you already have it though, You got to try it out at least. But three times, I'd say. Yeah, probably doing some photography, like just for fun and just like walking around and um observing people watching is always fun. Uh Yeah. And and then I'd say maybe free time sometimes I like to just like build random things like over the course of like um over the course of like a few months. Sometimes I like work on something just like on the side where like it won't ever see the light of day and I won't show it to anyone ever. But it's just like a personal, like, let me just like try with that sort of a thing. Yeah. So I kind of do some sort of, some of those things sometimes. I just like brainstorm and like put down little notes of things that I want to revisit down the line, but that I don't have time to right now. But yeah, I guess those are generally things to do, of course, eat sleep, hang out with friends, of course. Okay. 
 
 Yeah, awesome. Well, thank you so much. Is there anything that you'd like to plug or promote? 
 
 Uh, I guess check out my magazines, all sites, of course that spikes that or Yeah. Or check out my socials. 
 
 Thank you so much. Amazing. You're an activist and artist programmer or I guess front and designer. Um, thank you for speaking with me today. This has been a great conversation and thank you for being the first guests on my show. 
 
 Of course, I'm so excited to be here.
