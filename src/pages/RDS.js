            A blackout has occurred in New York City. Three hospitals have used
            up their backup power supplies due to the unanticipated duration of
            the blackout. There are some power supply areas in the city with
            fuel cells that supply enough power for the hospitals' need. In
            order to save lives, Mayor Bill de Blasio has issued an RFP for a
            robot that can retrieve and deliver fuel cells accumulating a
            minimum of 200 hours of reserve energy.

            Your robot must be able to navigate the course autonomously around
            the city and retrieve fuel cells and deliver them to hospitals, in
            less than 5 minutes. You must design the product with the tools
            given (Lego Mindstorms, Lego Digital Designer, Autodesk Fusion360,
            etc).

          For the project we separated our roles to efficiently accomplish tasks
          and finish on time. I was the Project Coordinator, and was in charge
          of keeping our progress on track and making sure all the requirements
          were met. We were a team of a Head Builder, Director of Software, and
          Project Coordinator. Together, we were RCC Builders and Developers,
          and our robotâ€™s name was Poppy.
        </p>
        <p>
          To plan out the schedule of the project I used Microsoft Project and
          made the template myself. I also made the cost estimate table for our
          project, so that we could demonstrate that our robot design was not
          only efficient but also cost effective.

          All the milestone presentations and the final presentation were made
          by myself as well, and I always made sure we covered every detail that
          would showcase our robotâ€™s best features. When we submitted our
          project, we successfully completed the mission, budgeted an
          inexpensive cost estimate, had a higher performance than our
          competitors, and created innovative code that ensured Poppy stay on
          course.

          We created two designs for our robot, and tested to see which would be
          the most efficient for the course. When reworking our second design,
          we kept in mind the time frame we had to keep for the projectâ€™s
          mission. So, we created a design that could hold multiple fuel cells
          at once, minimizing the time taken, while also maximizing the number
          of fuel cells transported.

          At the end of the semester, our robot delivered 210 fuel cell hours in
          under one minute. To pick up fuel cells, we 3D printed an exterior
          robot part, that served as a ramp to easily retrieve fuel cells. To
          ensure the robot could move autonomously on the course while also
          traveling in the best way, we added a gyro sensor to help stay
          straight and navigate the course.

              The efficient mechanism of four arm pairs on the robot, made it so
              multiple fuel cells can be carried at once. They all operated on a
              gear mechanism too easily be reset automatically by Poppy. The
              wider arm design also lowered the margin of error when obtaining
              fuel cells.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our Mindstorms code, we used structured code blocks that had
              designated purposes, such as a straight driving function,
              retrieval of a fuel cell, and loops that would execute these
              commands.
