        Huztle actually started as an idea in my Podcasting Workshop class in
        Spring 2021. The course is taught in the Tisch School of the Arts, and
        helps students cultivate audio projects throughout the semester that
        they can use to create their own podcasts. The class collective Podcast
        is{" "}
        <a href="https://unmutepodcast.org/about" className="nyu link">
          Unmute
